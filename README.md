As tradition in in my friendship group, we have a secret Santa. This year the theme was 'hand made'.

Naturally, I am hand making a meme generator.

On click, a new image and string will generate on the page.

I will build functions which generate two different numbers, which either correlate to the name of the static image, or the key of my string object.

The images of my friend are awful.

The strings of things my friend has said are also awful (some are inside jokes/ said in obscure contexts).

I hope they like it!
